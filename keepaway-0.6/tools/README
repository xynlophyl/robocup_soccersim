INSTALL:
  make
  cp clean monitor hist winsum /some/directory/in/your/path

Example data analysis:

  Generate learning curve for example.kwy.  We will use a 
  sliding window of 1000 episodes and 0.01 as the constant
  for the low-pass filter (the smaller it is, the smoother
  the graph).  The output is written to "1.out"
  
  cat example.kwy | winsum 1000 0.01 > 1.out

  Now let's create a postscript figure for this plot and
  output it to "graph.eps"

  gnuplot graph.gnuplot
  gv graph.eps

  Generate a histogram of episode durations for example.kwy.
  We will use bins of size 2.0 seconds.  The histogram is
  written to "1.hist".

  cat example.kwy | hist 2.0 > 1.hist

  Now let's create a postscript figure for this histogram
  and output it to "hist.eps"

  gnuplot hist.gnuplot
  gv hist.eps
